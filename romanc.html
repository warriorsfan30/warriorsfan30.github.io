		<p>     The Romans were very religious people. They held festivals to honor the gods. The Romans were also very practical, and they used it in their religious lives. They weren’t sure which gods were real, so they worshipped all the gods. The Roman allowed people they conquered to keep their beliefs. Sometimes, the romans even took their beliefs and used them in their religion. For example, when the Romans invaded greece, they used their gods in roman religion.They also used gods from the Egyptians, Gauls, and Persians.
	Roman leaders though Judaism was a potential problem. The Jews didn’t believe in many gods, and thought their god was the only god. Some romans thought they were insulting them by not worshiping their gods. Political conflict was starting between the Jews and the Romans. In 63 BC, the Jews rebelled, as they wanted to be in a land ruled by a Jew. They were defeated and punished for their actions.  Another revolt happened in the 100’s and Emperor Hadrian, tired of stopping jewish revolts, he banned the practice of some Jewish rituals. He thought it would make people to give up judaism and their desire of independence. That just made one more revolt, and the Roman Army crushed the revolt, destroyed the Jewish capital of Jerusalem, and forced all Jews to leave that city. The Romans built a new city on the ruins of Jerusalem, and brought settlers to live there. The Romans banned the Jews from visiting the city more than once a year.</p>

          		<p>The origins of Christianity in Jewish Messianic prophecies were According to the Bible, Jesus was born in a small town called Bethlehem at the end of the first century BC. As a young man Jesus lived in the town of Nazareth. As a young man Jesus lived in the town of Nazareth, he also studied the laws and teachings of Judaism. When he was about 30, Jesus had begun to travel and teach.  Because of his teachings and actions this started the beginning of the New Testament. According to the New Testament, many people became Jesus's followers after they saw him perform miracles. This is how the origins of christianity started.

          	<p    Some of the first christians like Paul were spreading their message about Jesus with the world. Some Christians, like Paul Christianity was spreading quickly in Rome, and it began to concern some Roman leader, and they looked for ways to end this religion. Most of Rome’s emperors let Christians worship, but a few emperors in the 200s and 300s, though, feared that the Christians could cause unrest in the empire. To prevent such unrest, these emperors banned Christianity. This ban led to several periods of persecution against Christians. Persecution means punishing a group because of its beliefs or differences. That meant that Christians had to meet in secret, and identified each other with symbols like a fish. These groups had no one to lead, so people called bishops, or local Christian leaders, lead each group. By the late 100’s Christians were looking at the bishops of large cities for guidance. Christian writers read the works of philosophers. One was Augustine. He studied the works of Plato. Once he became a Christian, he applied Plato's ideas to Christian Beliefs. Augustine taught that Christians should focus not on worldly goods but on God’s plan for the world. His ideas helped shape Christian beliefs for hundreds of years. 
     At about the same time that Saint Augustine was writing, an event changed the standing of Christians in Rome. The emperor himself became a Christian.
